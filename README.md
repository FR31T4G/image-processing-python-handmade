# image-processing-python-handmade
It's a image processing handmade in python. I create some filters and geometrics transformations.

**Filters**
  - Monocromatic
  - Diference
  - Binary
  - performance
  - contrast enlargement
  - scale
  - low pass
  - high pass
  - rotation
  - translation

For execute all you need, it's change the image for whatever you want and call the functions.
